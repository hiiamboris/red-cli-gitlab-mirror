; Putting the runtime first in results, and memory second, helps things

; as any code using the data with expected field indexes will break if
; we don't add the new stats at the end. We could use named fields as
; well but, for now, we'll stick with this and let this comment serve
; as a warning. More stats will certainly come in the future, as will
; GC, but this is just a quickie function in any case.
